# Telegram bot to get all messages real-time

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/chrisvxd/puppeteer-social-image.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/chrisvxd/puppeteer-social-image) [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/puppeteer-social-image.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-social-image)

The bot would be programmed to monitor all Telegram channels and groups for new messages. Once a new message is posted, the bot would immediately detect it and extract the relevant information such as the message content, sender's id, date, and time. Then the bot would post that information to the database.
